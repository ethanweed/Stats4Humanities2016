## R Markdown
This script makes a mean of A

```{r}
#This is A, which is a vector/array/list/line of numbers
A = c(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0)
mean(A)
```

save the mean of A as B

```{r}
# this is also a script, it saves the mean in a new variable B
B = mean(A)
B
```

plot A

```{r}
plot(A)
```

That was fun
