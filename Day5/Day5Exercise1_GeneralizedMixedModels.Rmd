# Language development in Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)

In this exercise we will explore language development in US children with and without ASD.

### Structure of the exercise

Basic stuff:
- Loading the libraries
- Setting the directory and loading the data
- Look at the data (which variables are there? Are they in the right format)
- Describe the participants (by diagnosis)

We will try to answer two separate questions:

- Do children with ASD develop language differently from non-ASD children?
- Do parents speak differently to children with ASD than to non-ASD ones?
  
### Loading the relevant libraries

Load necessary libraries : what will you need?

- e.g. something to plot with
```{r}

```
